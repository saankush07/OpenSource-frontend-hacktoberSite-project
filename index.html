      <h3>Prizes For Participating In The Hacktoberfest</h3>
      <p class="prize-info">
        Prizes are a key component of the challenge.
        <br />
        This year's rule remains the same: have 4 successful contributions and
        you are eligible for cool prizes.
        <br />
        However, the 2023 edition has... no t-shirts ðŸ˜­
        <br />
        They explained that the logistics for this are becoming increasingly
        difficult as the event gets bigger.
        <br />
        However, you will still receive some cool presents!
        <br />
        In this edition, you will receive a digital reward kit and the first
        50,000 participants to have their first PR accepted will have a tree
        planted in their name through Tree Nation (thatâ€™s pretty neat ðŸŒ±ðŸŒŽ).

      <h3>Support Open Source</h3>
      <p class="prize-info">
        Prizes are a key component of the challenge.
        <br />
        Open source projects, maintained by community-minded coders, make the
        modern internet function. Supporting that essential work, and the folks
        behind it, is what Hacktoberfest is all about.
